The Extreme ultraviolet Coronal Mass Ejection and Coronal Connectivity Observatory (ECCCO) is a [NASA Small Explorer Mission currently conducting a concept study](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-four-small-explorer-mission-concept-studies/). 
The mission consists of a single spacecraft with two instruments, a wide-field extreme ultra-violet imager and a unique imaging EUV spectrograph. ECCCO’s observations 
would contribute to understanding the middle corona, the dynamics of eruptive events leaving the Sun, and the conditions that produce the outward streaming solar wind. 
The mission would address fundamental questions about where the mass and energy flow linking the Sun to the outer corona and heliosphere originate ECCCO’s concept study principal 
investigator is Katharine Reeves from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
